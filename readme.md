# Blind 75 LeetCode Solutions in Python as PDF and Markdown

This project provides comprehensive solutions to the Blind 75 LeetCode questions, implemented in Python. It includes both easy and optimized solutions for each problem, along with time and space complexity and similar interview questions.

Check Output Director for PDF, MarkDown

This Repo can be easily extened to more problems if you want to add it.

## Features

- Solutions for all Blind 75 LeetCode questions
- Easy and optimized implementations for each problem
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Similar interview questions for each problem
- Markdown and PDF output for offline access and no-screen reading

## Requirements

To run this project, you need:

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
